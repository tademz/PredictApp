# PredictApp

The Prediction Model App is used to determine a predicted value once a linear model formula has been identified. The App uses the Y = B0 + B1 * x formula for the calculation.

A user enters the slope, intercept, and an x value for the model to provide a simple linear prediction value. The predicted value is then displayed along with the inputs the user entered into the App.
